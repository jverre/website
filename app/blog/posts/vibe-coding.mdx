# What I learned vibe coding a VS-Code extension

As I've been trying out different coding assistants, I've been looking at ways of keeping track of the conversations I have with these assistants.
I came across [SpecStory](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory) but it only works with Cursor while I needed to save my chats with
[Zencoder](https://zencoder.ai/).

I took on the challenge of building a VS-code extension that would log all my Zencoder chats to [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik). By the way
if you haven't tried out Zencoder yet, I highly recommend it !

> You can try the VS-code today, just search for `Opik - Chat history` in the VScode marketplace.

## Figuring out how to build the integration

The first set in figuring out how to build the extension was to find where Zencoder stores it's chat history. Since you can load the most recent
chats from the Zencoder sidebar, I assumed these where stored locally somewhere. To find them, I first started a new conversation with a single user
message with `7eda9d8e` and from the command line I ran:

```bash
find "/Users/jacques/Library/Application Support/code/" -type f -exec grep -l "7eda9d8e" {} +
```

This allowed me to find that Zencoder stores the chat conversations in two files:

1. `sessions.json`: Stores metadata about each chat conversation (title, last updated time, etc)
2. `/sessions/{id}.json`: Stores the list of messages for each chat conversation

Based on this finding, I could now plan the extension. It would be quite straightforward, every
5 seconds I would poll for changes in the `sessions.json` file and upload the corresponding chats
to Opik:

With this plan, we can go ahead and create the extension.

## Writing the extension with Zencoder

I'm not a very good Typescript developer, it only makes sense to use Zencoder to create the extension.
After some basic prompting, I had a plan for the architecture of the extension. It would be a sinmple
loop that would run every 5 seconds that would:

1. Get a list of the chat sessions that have been updated since the last loop
2. Fetch the chat messages for each session that has been updated
3. Convert the chat messages to the Opik trace format
4. Log the traces to Opik

This was quite straight forward and a first version was quickly implemented. I did run into an issue
related to some messages being logged more than once but by asking Zencoder:

> Some chat messages are logged more than once, review the code and suggest some reasons for this as well
as ways to figure out the root cause.

Zencoder was able to identify a missing `continue` statement that once added resolved the issue.

### Vibe coding

"Vibe coding" is a recent term that refers to a development approach that heavily relies on LLMs, typically
achieved by using the "Agent" mode in Cursor, Windsurf or Zencoder.

While I tried "vibe coding" at the beginning of the project, I quickly reverted back to the chat mode.
Having an LLM update files for you is convenient but I quickly lost track of the changes being made and new
issues where popping up right left and center. This is not a Zencoder issue, I had the same issues with
Cursor and Windsurf.

The chat mode in all the AI coding agents provides the perfect balance between usefulness and control.
Having a chat that has access to your full codebase for context is incredibly useful and avoids the
painful copy and pasting into Claude of ChatGPT.

## Using the extension

You can find the [Opik - Chat history extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jverre.opik-zencoder-chat-history)
in the VScode marketplace. To install it, simply ssearch for `Opik - Chat History` in the VScode marketplace
and click install.

Once installed, you will need to configure it by specifying your Opik API key. For this, navigate to the
VSCode settings page and search for `opikHistory.APIKey`.

Once configured, each Zencoder chat will be logged to the Opik platform:
