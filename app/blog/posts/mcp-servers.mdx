# MCP Servers are great - Wait are they really?

The Anthropic team released a new paradigm called MCP (Model Context Protocol) which allows LLMs to
interact with other applications. It quickly caught on with many companies releasing MCP servers to
interact with their services ([Slack](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack),
[Jira](https://github.com/rahulthedevil/Jira-Context-MCP), [HuggingFace](https://github.com/evalstate/mcp-hfspace),
etc).


After writing an MCP server from scratch, I'm left wondering:

> Are MCP servers popular just because they are easy to implement ?

## What is an MCP Server ?

While the [MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/) is complex,
it mostly boils down down to two endpoints:

1. Tool list: Returns a list of tools that are available as well as it's specification
2. Tool call: Calls a tool with the provided arguments

There are additional features related to prompts and resources but they are not nearly as common.

The reason MCP servers have gotten so much traction is that they standardize the interface between
application developers and LLM client developers. What is important to note here is that MCP servers
really rely on LLM clients, they are the ones that do most of the heavy lifting.

### Creating an MCP server

The best way to really understand MCP servers is to build one. Thankfully, Anthropic has created an SDK
that we can use to create a simple server. Creating the server is as simple as:

```python

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp import types

mcp = FastMCP("simple-mcp-server")

@mcp.tool()
def hello_world(input: str) -> types.TextContent:
    """Say hello to the user"""
    return types.TextContent(
        type="text",
        text=f"Hello {input}!"
    )
```

This implementation doesn't really allow us to understand what the MCP specification is all about. For that, we need to
build the server from scratch.

### Writing MCP server from scratch

In order to really understand the MCP specs, I attempted to recreate the MCP server from scratch using FastAPI but without
the MCP SDK. This implementation is available [here](https://github.com/jverre/chrome-mcp-server). It was a very interesting
exercise that I would recommend everyone excited about MCP servers to try.

When you start reading the specification, you quickly realize that the MCP server is not as straightforward as it seems. You would
expect the server to specify one GET endpoint and one POST endpoint, if only it were that simple!

Instead, the specifications rely on [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events). The
core concept is that a first API call is made to establish a connection and subsequently the client will make a POST request and
the response will return using the SSE connection. Let's take a look at this quick diagram to better understand this process:

![MCP Server Diagram](/img/blog/mcp-servers-protocol.png)

I haven't yet fully understood why this implementation approach is necessary, seems like a convoluted way to implement
**tool calling**. Sure it might be useful in more complex use-cases but most MCP servers are just simple tool calls !

When creating an MCP server, you need to handle two main flows:

1. Initialization flow: Initial request that starts a new SSE connection
2. Tool call flow: Subsequent POST requests to the server

#### Initialization flow

The initialization flow requires a few different steps, first a connection is established and then the server and client share the
functionality they each support. In order to support this, I had to implement a queueing mechanism so that everytime a message is
received from the client, the response is queued and returned to the client using the SSE connection. This adds a lot of complexity
to the implementation and to be honest I'm not sure why this approach was taken !

One of the challenges in building this flow is that you need a way to test that the implementationn is correct. For this I
recommend two things:

1. Using the MCP inspector: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector
2. Downloading a demo MCP server and connecting it to the inspector

The inspector doesn't surface errors when failing to initialize the server which made it very hard to debug my implementation. The
easiest way I have found to debug this was to compare the working demo server with my implementation. After some trial and error I
was able to get my MCP server working. If you would like to learn more about the initialization flow, you can check my bare bones
implementation [here](https://github.com/jverre/chrome-mcp-server/).

#### Tool call flow

The tool call flow is a lot more straightforward as we've already implemented the communication mechanism between the server and
the client as part of the initialization flow. The only thing we need to do is to implement the logic for the tool call.

For each tool call, we simply need to parse the incoming message and route it to the correct tool based on the `name` field in the
message. Once the tool has been called, we need to return the result using the SSE connection.

### Final thoughts

Writing an MCP server from scratch was a very insightful experience, it really dampened my enthusiasm ... The specification seems
overly complex for the most common use-case: Tool calling.

## What is wrong with MCP servers ?

One of the main benefits of MCP servers is that they provide a standard way to interact with other applications. Anthropic has also
released great libraries that make it very easy to implement new MCP servers, as a result the cost of building a server is close to
zero. I think this is why we have seen such a proliferation of MCP servers over the last few months, I honestly don't think it is
because users are looking to interact with all these other applications.

> MCP servers are popular because they are easy to implement, but who is actually using these ?

My biggest complaint about MCP servers is that they are hard to use, not only do you need to run them locally but you also need to
configure the authentication method by manually editing environment files. This makes it challenging for less technical users to
use these servers and makes it a challenge to use on a daily basis.

Perhaps someone should create a OpenMCP service similar to OpenRouter ?
